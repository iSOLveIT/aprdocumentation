Merge models
##############################

Apromore allows us to merge models and animate a log on top of the merged models.

In order to merge a model, select two models and click on *Redesign -> Merge Models*.

A window will pop up which will allow us to name the merged model. Enter the name and click on *OK*.

The merged model will now appear in the repository.

We can view the merged model in the BPMN editor.
