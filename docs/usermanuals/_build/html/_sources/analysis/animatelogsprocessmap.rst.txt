Animate logs (Process map)
##############################

Apromore allows us to replay an event log on top of its process map. To use this plugin, select an event log from the repository and click the *Animate* button in the process discoverer.

The process map within Editor along with the timeline is displayed.

.. note:: Once the animation button is clicked, other functionalities like abstraction and visualization settings are disabled.

-------------------
Standard Controls
-------------------

The animation will start by hitting the *Play* button. Each token represents the progress of a particular process instance, i.e., a case.

|image3|

Standard controls are available to play, pause, fast or slow forward/rewind the animation and to skip through the end/beginning. The replay speed can be changed with the vertical bar. These actions are also available during the animation. If the view on the process map is zoomed in/out, or the process map layout is changed, the tool will try to adapt the animation to the new position of the elements on the canvas.

.. tip:: To zoom-in/zoom-out, press *Ctrl* and use the mouse scroll wheel

We can change the color of tokens by clicking on the *pie chart*.

.. note:: We can either choose from the default colors or add the customized ones. To add a customized color - enter a color code or drag the mouse over the palette.

To check log-related statistics, hover over the *pie chart*.

----------------
Token Traversal
----------------

A token traversing an activity indicates that the case captured by that token is performing that activity. However, if the token goes around an activityâ€™s border, this indicates that the particular activity is skipped in that process case.

|image4|

A token of a larger size or a large number of tokens slowly traversing a given path may indicate a performance bottleneck, e.g. cases pile up in a particular point of the process due to resources unavailability.
