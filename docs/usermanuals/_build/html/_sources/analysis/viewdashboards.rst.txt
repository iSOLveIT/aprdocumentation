*Apromore's Custom Performance Dashboard* allows users to analyze a business process from a performance measurement perspective visually. The *Performance Dashboard* displays a variety of aggregate statistics and charts. The *Performance Dashboard plugin* allows us to analyze one process in isolation or to compare multiple process variants. For example, we can use the *Performance Dashboard plugin* to compare how a given process is executed across multiple regions or compare the variant of a process consisting of slow cases versus faster cases.

To open the dashboard plugin, select at least one event log and click on *Analyze - > View performance dashboard*. To compare multiple process variants, we need to select multiple event logs and then open the Performance Dashboard plugin.

The customizable performance dashboard consists of three default views: *Overview*, *Activities*, and *Resources*. All the dashboards include statistic tiles, charts, and tables.

The overview section's stat tiles consist of the event log's performance measures like the number of activity instances, active cases over time, case variants, case duration, and log timeframe. Four main charts are presented in the overview dashboard: Events over time, Active cases over time, Case variants, and Case utilization.
