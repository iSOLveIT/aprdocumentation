Navigating the Apromore Portal
===============================

The Apromore Portal is the first and primary interface that users access. One can navigate the workspace folders and perform various actions through the available plugins. This introduction covers the basics of the Apromore Portal.

Please refer to the various entries in the :doc:`user guide <../index>` for specific plugins information and capability.

To view the Apromore portal, log in using valid credentials.

The Apromore Portal appears after successfully logging in. The workspace folder structure/folders tree is on the left-hand side of the portal window in the *My workspace* area. We can expand/collapse individual folders by using the arrow icon next to each folder. We can also expand/collapse all folders at once using the two icons located on the top-right of the folders tree.

|image2|

The central area of the portal contains the file view. The file view shows folders, process models (represented by a flowchart icon), and event logs (represented by a logbook icon). We can view the files either in grid or list format.

|image4|

We can see the details such as version, last update time, and owner of a process model in the *Details* view.

|image5|

.. note:: The *Details* view is populated only when a process model is selected

We can double-click on a process model to edit it using the BPMN 2.0 standard in the :doc:`Apromore Editor <createoreditprocessmodel>`. Likewise, we can also double-click on an event log to reverse-engineer the process map or BPMN model from the selected log in the :doc:`Process Discoverer <../discovery/discovermodel>`.


-----------
File Menu
-----------

The *File* menu is used to manipulate files, such as uploading or downloading models and logs, creating a new folder or process model, renaming a file, and deleting it. The other menus (:doc:`Discover <../discovery/index>`, :doc:`Analyze <../analysis/index>`, :doc:`Redesign <../redesign/index>`) provide access to the various process mining and process model manipulation plugins.

We can access the user guide from the *question mark* button on the top-right corner of the Portal.
