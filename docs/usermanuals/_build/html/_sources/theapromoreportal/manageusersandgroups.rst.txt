Manage users and groups
##############################

Users and groups management functionality allows us to grant permissions to users for either using features or different artifacts. Each user can belong to a group or can be associated with a role. A Role is an attribute of the user. A Group is a set of users and is about access rights to different folders/files (e.g. as a member of the group Sales I can only access files related to the Sales Department).

.. note:: Only a user with administrator rights can access the *Manage users and groups* functionality

Click on the *Manage users and groups* button.
