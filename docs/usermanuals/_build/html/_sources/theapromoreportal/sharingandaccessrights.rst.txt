Sharing and Access Rights
===============================

Apromore allows us to share files/folders. Each file/folder has a particular security level.

.. note:: By default, each file/folder is created and saved as private and can be accessed, edited, deleted only by the owner.

It is possible to change a file/folder's security level by selecting it in the workspace and clicking the |image0.1| button.

File Sharing window consists of two sections: *List of Users* and *Associated artifacts*.

.. note:: To share all the artifacts (filters/dashboards) associated with a log, set the *Viewer (full)* permission to the user. To share only specific artifacts(filters/dashboards) associated with a log, set the *Viewer (restricted)* permission to the user and tick the boxes next to the artifacts to be shared.

We can find a user or group with whom we want to share the file using the *Type in a user or group name* textbox.

Click on *Share*.
