"*Apromore's Custom Performance Dashboard* allows users to analyze a "
"business process from a performance measurement perspective visually. The"
" *Performance Dashboard* displays a variety of aggregate statistics and "
"charts. The *Performance Dashboard plugin* allows us to analyze one "
"process in isolation or to compare multiple process variants. For "
"example, we can use the *Performance Dashboard plugin* to compare how a "
"given process is executed across multiple regions or compare the variant "
"of a process consisting of slow cases versus faster cases."
