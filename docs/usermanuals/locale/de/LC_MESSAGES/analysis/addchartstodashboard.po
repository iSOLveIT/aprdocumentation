"Apromore's Performance Dashboard allows users to analyze a business "
"process from a performance measurement perspective visually. The "
"Performance Dashboard displays a variety of aggregate statistics and "
"charts. The *Performance Dashboard plugin* allows us to analyze one "
"process in isolation or to compare multiple process variants. For "
"example, we can use the *Performance Dashboard plugin* to compare how a "
"given process is executed across multiple regions or compare the variant "
"of a process consisting of slow cases versus faster cases."

"A case variant is a sequence of activities followed by one or more cases,"
" i.e., a distinct pathway. For example, if A, B, C, and D represent "
"activities, then ABCD, ACBD, and ABC represent three case variants. "
"Typically, there are multiple cases in a log that follow the same case "
"variant. For example, it may be that 10 cases follow the case variant "
"ABCD, while 5 cases follow the case variant ACBD. The *Case variants "
"chart* displays the number of cases that follow each variant. The "
"variants are sorted from most frequent to least frequent."
