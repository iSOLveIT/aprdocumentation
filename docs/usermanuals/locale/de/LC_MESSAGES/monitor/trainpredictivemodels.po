"The Training plugin allows users to generate predictive models for "
"different types of predictions. Specifically, it is able to predict "
"generic process properties, such as remaining time until case completion,"
" the next most likely activity to be executed and whether a case will "
"take longer than a user-defined time threshold. Additionally, the tool "
"can build models to predict log-specific case properties, for example, "
"the total application cost in an insurance claims handling process."

"Before importing your log into Apromore, it needs to be pre-processed to "
"add all the required attributes.  The tutorial here describes a "
"minimalist example of pre-processing operations for an event log. For "
"demonstration purposes, Apromore repository provides several pre-"
"processed logs under Examples/Predictive Monitoring folder. These logs "
"can also be downloaded from `here  "
"<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZATjpBMSjgxLDKdIvLOJ15NRz_N0b6K0/view>`_."
