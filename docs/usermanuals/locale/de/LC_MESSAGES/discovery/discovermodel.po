"Apromore allows us to discover a process map or a BPMN model from an "
"event log. A process map (a.k.a. directly-follows graph) is a visual "
"representation of the log as a graph where nodes capture process "
"activities and directed arcs between them capture sequential order "
"relations between the activities. For example, an arc going from activity"
" *Accept order* to activity *Check order* indicates that in the log, we "
"can observe that process cases flow from *Accept order* to *Check order*."
" Process maps are a simple yet effective means to understand the basic "
"order of relationships between process activities. As such, they are the "
"most common type of model discovered by commercial process mining tools."
